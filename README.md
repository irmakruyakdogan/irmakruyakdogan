WELCOME TO GREAT CİRCLE OF LİFE
-  Hey, My name is Irmak Rüya AKDOĞAN and I'm 18 years old.
-  I am a 1st year student of information systems and technologies at Sivas Cumhuriyet University.
-  I'm interested in coding and I've been working on it day and night. I'm currently learning python
and java for my project.
-  I want to work on mobile applications.
-  Life is not all about studying. But if you can't even conquer this little part of life, then
what else can you possibly do?
-  You can reach me irmakakdogan2@gmail.com
